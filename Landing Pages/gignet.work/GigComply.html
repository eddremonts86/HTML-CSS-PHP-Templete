          <p>This monitoring service is designed in response to operatorsâ€™ needs to further strengthen control over
            third party advertising and brand protection. GiG Comply drives responsible gaming by providing improved
            visibility of where and how brands are being advertised. The service helps protect them from promotion on
            websites which are not brand-safe. It also protects from misleading advertising in their name and helps them
            to adhere to complex advertising standards in their regulated markets.</p>

            <p>This scalable tool is based on cutting-edge technology, putting flexibility in the hands of the operators
            who can set up their own criteria and checklist parameters to scan and check affiliate websites or any
            requested domains on a daily basis. This will allow them to scan for anything they need, such as ensuring
            responsible gaming measures are visible on relevant pages or that terms and conditions are correct and
            up-to-date.</p>
